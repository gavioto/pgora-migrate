.SH "NAME"
Ora2Pg \- Oracle to PostgreSQL database schema converter
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Ora2Pg is a free tool used to migrate an Oracle database to a
PostgreSQL compatible schema. It connects your Oracle database, scan it
automatically and extracts its structure or data, it then generates \s-1SQL\s0
scripts that you can load into your PostgreSQL database.
.PP
Ora2Pg can be used from reverse engineering Oracle database to huge enterprise
database migration or simply to replicate some Oracle data into a PostgreSQL
database. It is really easy to used and doesn't need any Oracle database
knowledge than providing the parameters needed to connect to the Oracle
database.
.SH "FEATURES"
.IX Header "FEATURES"
Ora2Pg consist of a Perl script (ora2pg) and a Perl module (Ora2Pg.pm), the
only thing you have to modify is the configuration file ora2pg.conf by setting
the \s-1DSN\s0 to the Oracle database and optionaly the name of a schema. Once that's
done you just have to set the type of export you want: \s-1TABLE\s0 with constraints,
\&\s-1VIEW, MVIEW, TABLESPACE, SEQUENCE, INDEXES, TRIGGER, GRANT, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE,
PACKAGE, PARTITION, TYPE, INSERT\s0 or \s-1COPY, FDW, QUERY, KETTLE .\s0
.PP
By default Ora2Pg exports to a file that you can load into PostgreSQL with the
psql client, but you can also import directly into a PostgreSQL database by
setting its \s-1DSN\s0 into the configuration file. With all configuration options of
ora2pg.conf you have full control of what should be exported and how.
.PP
Features included:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        \- Export full database schema (tables, views, sequences, indexes), with
\&          unique, primary, foreign key and check constraints.
\&        \- Export grants/privileges for users and groups.
\&        \- Export range and list partition.
\&        \- Export a table selection (by specifying the table names).
\&        \- Export Oracle schema to a PostgreSQL 8.4+ schema.
\&        \- Export predefined functions, triggers, procedures, packages and
\&          package bodies.
\&        \- Export full data or following a WHERE clause.
\&        \- Full support of Oracle BLOB object as PG BYTEA.
\&        \- Export Oracle views as PG tables.
\&        \- Export Oracle user defined types.
\&        \- Provide some basic automatic conversion of PLSQL code to PLPGSQL.
\&        \- Works on any plateform.
\&        \- Export Oracle tables as foreign data wrapper tables.
\&        \- Export materialized view.
\&        \- Show a detailled report of an Oracle database content.
\&        \- Migration cost assessment of an Oracle database.
\&        \- Migration cost assessment of PL/SQL code from a file.
\&        \- Migration cost assessment of Oracle SQL queries stored in a file.
\&        \- Generate XML ktr files to be used with Penthalo Data Integrator (Kettle)
.Ve
.PP
Ora2Pg do its best to automatically convert your Oracle database to PostgreSQL
but there's still manual works to do. The Oracle specific \s-1PL/SQL\s0 code generated
for functions, procedures, packages and triggers has to be reviewed to match
the PostgreSQL syntax. You will find some useful recommandations on porting
Oracle \s-1PL/SQL\s0 code to PostgreSQL \s-1PL/PGSQL\s0 at \*(L"Converting from other Databases
to PostgreSQL\*(R", section: Oracle (http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Main_Page).
.PP
See http://ora2pg.darold.net/report.html for a \s-1HTML\s0 sample of an Oracle database
migration report.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.IX Header "INSTALLATION"
All Perl modules can always be found at \s-1CPAN \s0(http://search.cpan.org/). Just
type the full name of the module (ex: DBD::Oracle) into the search input box,
it will brings you the page for download.
.PP
Releases of Ora2Pg stay at \s-1SF\s0.net (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ora2pg/).
.PP
Under Windows you should install Strawberry Perl (http://strawberryperl.com/)
and the OSes corresponding Oracle clients. It seems that compiling DBD::Oracle
from \s-1CPAN\s0 on Windows can be a struggle and there be little documentation on that
(mostly outdated and not working). Installing the free version of ActiveState
Perl (http://www.activestate.com/activeperl) could help as they seems to have
an already packaged DBD::Oracle easy to install.
.SS "Requirement"
.IX Subsection "Requirement"
You need a modern Perl distribution (perl 5.6 and more), the \s-1DBI\s0 and DBD::Oracle
Perl modules to be installed. These are used to connect to the Oracle database.
To install DBD::Oracle and have it working you need to have the Oracle client
libraries installed and the \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0 environment variable must be defined.
.PP
On old Perl version you may need to install the Time::HiRes Perl module.
.SS "Optional"
.IX Subsection "Optional"
By default Ora2Pg dumps export to flat files, to load them into your PostgreSQL
database you need the PostgreSQL client (psql). If you don't have it on the
host running Ora2Pg you can always transfer these files to a host with the psql
client installed. If you prefer to load export 'on the fly', the perl module
DBD::Pg is required.
.PP
Ora2Pg allow to dump all output int a compressed gzip file, to do that you need
the Compress::Zlib Perl module or if you prefer using bzip2 compression, the
program bzip2 must be available in your \s-1PATH.\s0
.SS "Installing Ora2Pg"
.IX Subsection "Installing Ora2Pg"
Like any other Perl Module Ora2Pg can be installed with the following commands:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        tar xzf ora2pg\-10.x.tar.gz
\&        cd ora2pg\-10.x/
\&        perl Makefile.PL
\&        make && make install
.Ve
.PP
This will install Ora2Pg.pm into your site Perl repository, ora2pg into
/usr/local/bin/ and ora2pg.conf into /etc/ora2pg/.
.PP
On Windows(tm) OSes you may use instead:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        perl Makefile.PL
\&        dmake && dmake install
.Ve
.PP
This will install scripts and libraries into your Perl site installation directory
and the ora2pg.conf file as well as all documentation files into C:\eora2pg\e
.SS "Packaging"
.IX Subsection "Packaging"
If you want to build binary package for your preferred Linux distribution take a
look at the packaging/ directory of the source tarball. There's everything to
build \s-1RPM,\s0 Slackware and Debian packages. See \s-1README\s0 file in that directory.
.SS "Installing DBD::Oracle"
.IX Subsection "Installing DBD::Oracle"
Ora2Pg need perl module DBD::Oracle for connectivity to an Oracle database from
perl \s-1DBI.\s0 To get DBD::Oracle get it from \s-1CPAN\s0 a perl module repository.
.PP
After setting \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0 and \s-1LD_LIBRARY_PATH\s0 environment variables as root
user, install DBD::Oracle. Proceed as follow:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib
\&        export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/
\&        perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall DBD::Oracle\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
If you are running for the first time it will ask so many questions which you
can keep defaults by pressing \s-1ENTER\s0 key, but you need to give one appropriate
i.e., mirror site for \s-1CPAN\s0 to download the modules. Or install through \s-1CPAN\s0
manually if the above don't works:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&        #perl \-MCPAN \-e shell
\&        cpan> get DBD::Oracle
\&        cpan> quit
\&        cd ~/.cpan/build/DBD\-Oracle*
\&        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib
\&        export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/
\&        perl Makefile.PL
\&        make
\&        make install
.Ve
.PP
Installing DBD::Oracle require that the three Oracle packages: instant-client,
\&\s-1SDK\s0 and SQLplus are installed.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
Ora2Pg configuration can be as simple as choose the Oracle database to export
and choose the export type. This can be done in the minute.
.PP
By reading this documentation you will also be able to:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        \- Select only certain tables and/or column for export.
\&        \- Rename some tables and/or column during export.
\&        \- Select data to export following a WHERE clause per table.
\&        \- Delay database constraints during data loading.
\&        \- Compress exported data to save disk space.
\&        \- and much more.
.Ve
.PP
The full control of the Oracle database migration is taken though a single
configuration file named ora2pg.conf. The format of this file consist in a
directive name in upper case followed by tab character and a value.
Comments are lines beginning with a #.
.SS "Ora2Pg usage"
.IX Subsection "Ora2Pg usage"
By default Ora2Pg will look for /etc/ora2pg/ora2pg.conf configuration file, if
the file exist you can simply execute:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        /usr/local/bin/ora2pg
.Ve
.PP
or under Windows(tm) run ora2pg.bat file, located in your perl bin directory.
Windows(tm) users may also find a template configuration file in C:\eora2pg
.PP
If you want to call another configuration file, just give the path as command
line argument:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        /usr/local/bin/ora2pg \-c /etc/ora2pg/new_ora2pg.conf
.Ve
.PP
Here are all command line parameters available when using ora2pg:

.SS "Oracle database connection"
.IX Subsection "Oracle database connection"
There's 5 configuration directives to control the access to the Oracle database.
.IP "\s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_HOME"
Used to set \s-1ORACLE_HOME\s0 environment variable to the Oracle libraries required
by the DBD::Oracle Perl module.
.IP "\s-1ORACLE_DSN\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_DSN"
This directive is used to set the data source name in the form standard \s-1DBI DSN.\s0
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:Oracle:host=oradb_host.myhost.com;sid=DB_SID
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:Oracle:DB_SID
.Ve
.Sp
for the second notation the \s-1SID\s0 should be declared in the well known file
\&\f(CW$ORACLE_HOME\fR/network/admin/tnsnames.ora.
.IP "\s-1ORACLE_USER\s0 et \s-1ORACLE_PWD\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_USER et ORACLE_PWD"
These two directives are used to define the user and password for the Oracle
database connection. Note that if you can it is better to login as Oracle super
admin to avoid grants problem during the database scan and be sure that nothing
is missing.
.IP "\s-1USER_GRANTS\s0" 4
.IX Item "USER_GRANTS"
Set this directive to 1 if you connect the Oracle database as simple user and
do not have enough grants to extract things from the \s-1DBA_...\s0 tables. It will
use tables \s-1ALL_...\s0 instead.
.Sp
Warning: if you use export type \s-1GRANT,\s0 you must set this configuration option
to 0 or it will not works.
.IP "\s-1TRANSACTION\s0" 4
.IX Item "TRANSACTION"
This directive may be used if you want to change the default isolation level of
the data export transaction. Default is now to set the level to a serializable
transaction to ensure data consistency. The allowed values for this directive
are:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        readonly: \*(AqSET TRANSACTION READ ONLY\*(Aq,
\&        readwrite: \*(AqSET TRANSACTION READ WRITE\*(Aq,
\&        serializable: \*(AqSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE\*(Aq
\&        committed: \*(AqSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED\*(Aq,
.Ve
.Sp
Releases before 6.2 used to set the isolation level to \s-1READ ONLY\s0 transaction
but in some case this was breaking data consistency so now default is set to
\&\s-1SERIALIZABLE.\s0
.IP "\s-1INPUT_FILE\s0" 4
.IX Item "INPUT_FILE"
This directive did not control the Oracle database connection or unless it
purely disable the use of any Oracle database by accepting a file as argument.
Set this directive to a file containing \s-1PL/SQL\s0 Oracle Code like function,
procedure or full package body to prevent Ora2Pg from connecting to an
Oracle database and just apply his convertion tool to the content of the
file. This can be used with the most of export types: \s-1TABLE, TRIGGER, PROCEDURE,
VIEW, FUNCTION\s0 or PACKAGEi, etc.
.SS "Data encryption with Oracle server"
.IX Subsection "Data encryption with Oracle server"
If your Oracle Client config file already includes the encryption method,
then DBD:Oracle uses those settings to encrypt the connection while you
extract the data. For example if you have configured the Oracle Client
config file (sqlnet.or or .sqlnet) with the following information:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        # Configure encryption of connections to Oracle
\&        SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT = required
\&        SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT = (AES256, RC4_256)
\&        SQLNET.CRYPTO_SEED = \*(Aqshould be 10\-70 random characters\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Any tool that uses the Oracle client to talk to the database will be
encrypted if you setup a session encryption like above.
.PP
For example, Perl's \s-1DBI\s0 uses DBD-Oracle, which uses the Oracle client
for actually handling database communication. If the installation of
Oracle client used by Perl is setup to request encrypted connections,
then your Perl connection to an Oracle database will also be encrypted.
.PP

.SS "Testing"
.IX Subsection "Testing"
Once you have set the Oracle database \s-1DSN\s0 you can execute ora2pg to see if
it works. By default the configuration file will export the database schema to
a file called 'output.sql'. Take a look in it to see if the schema has been
exported.
.PP
Take some time here to test your installation as most of the problem take place
here, the other configuration step are more technical.
.SS "Trouble shooting"
.IX Subsection "Trouble shooting"
If the output.sql file has not exported anything else than the Pg transaction
header and footer there's two possible reasons. The perl script ora2pg dump
an ORA-XXX error, that mean that you \s-1DSN\s0 or login information are wrong, check
the error and your settings and try again. The perl script says nothing and the
output file is empty: the user has not enough right to extract something from
the database. Try to connect Oracle as super user or take a look at directive
\&\s-1USER_GRANTS\s0 above and at next section, especiallly the \s-1SCHEMA\s0 directive.
.IP "\s-1LOGFILE\s0" 4
.IX Item "LOGFILE"
By default all message are sent to the standard output. If you give a file path to that directive, all output will be appended to this file.
.SS "Oracle schema to export"
.IX Subsection "Oracle schema to export"
The Oracle database export can be limited to a specific Schema or Namespace,
this can be mandatory following the database connection user.
.IP "\s-1SCHEMA\s0" 4
.IX Item "SCHEMA"
This directive is used to set the schema name to use during export.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SCHEMA  APPS
.Ve
.Sp
will extract objects associated to the \s-1APPS\s0 schema.
.IP "\s-1EXPORT_SCHEMA\s0" 4
.IX Item "EXPORT_SCHEMA"
By default the Oracle schema is not exported into the PostgreSQL database and
all objects are created under the default Pg namespace. If you want to also
export this schema and create all objects under this namespace, set the
\&\s-1EXPORT_SCHEMA\s0 directive to 1. This will set the schema search_path at top of
export \s-1SQL\s0 file to the schema name set in the \s-1SCHEMA\s0 directive with the default
pg_catalog schema. If you want to change this path, use the directive \s-1PG_SCHEMA.\s0
.IP "\s-1CREATE_SCHEMA\s0" 4
.IX Item "CREATE_SCHEMA"
Enable/disable the \s-1CREATE SCHEMA SQL\s0 order at starting of the output file.
It is enable by default and concern on \s-1TABLE\s0 export type.
.IP "\s-1COMPILE_SCHEMA\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPILE_SCHEMA"
By default Ora2Pg will only export valid \s-1PL/SQL\s0 code. You can force Oracle to
compile again the invalidated code to get a chance to have it obtain the valid
status and then be able to export it.
.Sp
Enable this directive to force Oracle to compile schema before exporting code.
This will ask to Oracle to validate the \s-1PL/SQL\s0 that could have been invalidate
after a export/import for example. If you set the value to 1 it will exec:
\&\s-1DBMS_UTILITY\s0.compile_schema(schema => sys_context('\s-1USERENV\s0', '\s-1SESSION_USER\s0'));
but if you provide the name of a particular schema it will use the following
command: \s-1DBMS_UTILITY\s0.compile_schema(schema => 'schemaname');
The '\s-1VALID\s0' or '\s-1INVALID\s0' status applies to functions, procedures, packages and
user defined types.
.IP "\s-1EXPORT_INVALID\s0" 4
.IX Item "EXPORT_INVALID"
If the above configuration directive is not enough to validate your \s-1PL/SQL\s0 code
enable this configuration directive to allow export of all \s-1PL/SQL\s0 code even if
it is marked as invalid. The '\s-1VALID\s0' or '\s-1INVALID\s0' status applies to functions,
procedures, packages and user defined types.
.IP "\s-1PG_SCHEMA\s0" 4
.IX Item "PG_SCHEMA"
Allow you to defined/force the PostgreSQL schema to use. The value can be a
comma delimited list of schema name. By default if you set \s-1EXPORT_SCHEMA\s0 to 1,
the PostgreSQL schema search_path will be set to the schema name set as value of
the \s-1SCHEMA\s0 directive plus the default pg_catalog schema as follow:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SET search_path = $SCHEMA, pg_catalog;
.Ve
.Sp
If you set \s-1PG_SCHEMA\s0 to something like \*(L"user_schema, public\*(R" for example the
search path will be set like this:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        SET search_path = $PG_SCHEMA;
\&        \-\- SET search_path = user_schema, public;
.Ve
.Sp
This will force to not use the Oracle schema set in the \s-1SCHEMA\s0 directive.
.IP "\s-1SYSUSERS\s0" 4
.IX Item "SYSUSERS"
Without explicit schema, Ora2Pg will export all objects that not belongs to
system schema or role:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        CTXSYS,DBSNMP,EXFSYS,LBACSYS,MDSYS,MGMT_VIEW,OLAPSYS,ORDDATA,OWBSYS,
\&        ORDPLUGINS,ORDSYS,OUTLN,SI_INFORMTN_SCHEMA,SYS,SYSMAN,SYSTEM,WK_TEST,
\&        WKSYS,WKPROXY,WMSYS,XDB,APEX_PUBLIC_USER,DIP,FLOWS_020100,FLOWS_030000,
\&        FLOWS_040100,FLOWS_FILES,MDDATA,ORACLE_OCM,SPATIAL_CSW_ADMIN_USR,
\&        SPATIAL_WFS_ADMIN_USR,XS$NULL,PERFSTAT,SQLTXPLAIN,DMSYS,TSMSYS,WKSYS,
\&        APEX_040200,DVSYS,OJVMSYS,GSMADMIN_INTERNAL,APPQOSSYS
.Ve
.Sp
Following your Oracle installation you may have several other system role
defined. To append these users to the schema exclusion list, just set the
\&\s-1SYSUSERS\s0 configuration directive to a comma-separated list of system user to
exclude. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SYSUSERS        INTERNAL,SYSDBA
.Ve
.Sp
will add users \s-1INTERNAL\s0 and \s-1SYSDBA\s0 to the schema exclusion list.
.IP "\s-1FORCE_OWNER\s0" 4
.IX Item "FORCE_OWNER"
By default the owner of the database objects is the one you're using to connect
to PostgreSQL using the psql command. If you use an other user (postgres for exemple)
you can force Ora2Pg to set the object owner to be the one used in the Oracle database
by setting the directive to 1, or to a completely different username by setting the
directive value to that username.
.IP "\s-1USE_TABLESPACE\s0" 4
.IX Item "USE_TABLESPACE"
When enabled this directive force ora2pg to export all tables, indexes constraint and
indexes using the tablespace name defined in Oracle database. This works only with
tablespace that are not \s-1TEMP, USERS\s0 and \s-1SYSTEM.\s0
.SS "Export type"
.IX Subsection "Export type"
The export action is perform following a single configuration directive '\s-1TYPE\s0',
some other add more control on what should be really exported.
.IP "\s-1TYPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "TYPE"
Here are the different values of the \s-1TYPE\s0 directive, default is \s-1TABLE:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&        \- TABLE: Extract all tables with indexes, primary keys, unique keys,
\&          foreign keys and check constraints.
\&        \- VIEW: Extract only views.
\&        \- GRANT: Extract roles converted to Pg groups, users and grants on all
\&          objects.
\&        \- SEQUENCE: Extract all sequence and their last position.
\&        \- TABLESPACE: Extract storage spaces for tables and indexes (Pg >= v8).
\&        \- TRIGGER: Extract triggers defined following actions.
\&        \- FUNCTION: Extract functions.
\&        \- PROCEDURE: Extract procedures.
\&        \- PACKAGE: Extract packages and package bodies.
\&        \- INSERT: Extract data as INSERT statement.
\&        \- COPY: Extract data as COPY statement.
\&        \- PARTITION: Extract range and list Oracle partitioning.
\&        \- TYPE: Extract user defined Oracle type.
\&        \- FDW: Export Oracle tables as foreign table for oracle_fdw.
\&        \- MVIEW: Export materialized view.
\&        \- QUERY: Try to automatically convert Oracle SQL queries.
\&        \- KETTLE: generate XML ktr template files to be used by Kettle.
.Ve
.Sp
Only one type of export can be perform at the same time so the \s-1TYPE\s0 directive
must be unique. If you have more than one only the last found in the file will
be registered.
.Sp
Some export type can not or should not be load directly into the PostgreSQL
database and still require little manual editing. This is the case for \s-1GRANT,
TABLESPACE, TRIGGER, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, TYPE, QUERY\s0 and \s-1PACKAGE\s0 export types
especially if you have \s-1PLSQL\s0 code or Oracle specific \s-1SQL\s0 in it.
.Sp
For \s-1TABLESPACE\s0 you must ensure that file path exist on the system.
.Sp
Note that you can chained multiple export by giving to the \s-1TYPE\s0 directive a
comma-separated list of export type.
.Sp
The \s-1PARTITION\s0 export is a work in progress as table partition support is not
yet implemented into PostgreSQL. Ora2Pg will convert Oracle partition using
table inheritence, trigger and function workaround. See document at Pg site:
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl\-partitioning.html
This new feature in Ora2Pg has not been widly tested so feel free to report
any bug and patch.
.Sp
The \s-1TYPE\s0 export allow export of user defined Oracle type. If you don't use the
\&\-\-plsql command line parameter it simply dump Oracle user type asis else Ora2Pg
will try to convert it to PostgreSQL syntax.
.Sp
The \s-1KETTLE\s0 export type requires that the Oracle and PostgreSQL \s-1DNS\s0 are defined.
.Sp
Since Ora2Pg v8.1 there's three new export types:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        SHOW_VERSION : display Oracle version
\&        SHOW_SCHEMA  : display the list of schema available in the database.
\&        SHOW_TABLE   : display the list of tables available.
\&        SHOW_COLUMN  : display the list of tables columns available and the
\&                Ora2PG conversion type from Oracle to PostgreSQL that will be
\&                applied. It will also warn you if there\*(Aqs PostgreSQL reserved
\&                words in Oracle object names.
.Ve
.Sp
Here is an example of the \s-1SHOW_COLUMN\s0 output:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&        [2] TABLE CURRENT_SCHEMA (1 rows) (Warning: \*(AqCURRENT_SCHEMA\*(Aq is a reserved word in PostgreSQL)
\&                CONSTRAINT : NUMBER(22) => bigint (Warning: \*(AqCONSTRAINT\*(Aq is a reserved word in PostgreSQL)
\&                FREEZE : VARCHAR2(25) => varchar(25) (Warning: \*(AqFREEZE\*(Aq is a reserved word in PostgreSQL)
\&        ...
\&        [6] TABLE LOCATIONS (23 rows)
\&                LOCATION_ID : NUMBER(4) => smallint
\&                STREET_ADDRESS : VARCHAR2(40) => varchar(40)
\&                POSTAL_CODE : VARCHAR2(12) => varchar(12)
\&                CITY : VARCHAR2(30) => varchar(30)
\&                STATE_PROVINCE : VARCHAR2(25) => varchar(25)
\&                COUNTRY_ID : CHAR(2) => char(2)
.Ve
.Sp
Those extraction keyword are use to only display the requested information and
exit. This allow you to quickly know on what you are going to work.
.Sp
The \s-1SHOW_COLUMN\s0 allow an other ora2pg command line option: '\-\-allow relname'
or '\-a relname' to limit the displayed information to the given table.
.Sp
Since Ora2Pg v8.2 there's a new export type:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SHOW_ENCODING : display the Oracle session encoding, useful to set NSL_LANG.
.Ve
.Sp
Since release v8.12, Ora2Pg allow you to export your Oracle Table definition to
be use with the oracle_fdw foreign data wrapper. By using type \s-1FDW\s0 your Oracle
tables will be exported as follow:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        CREATE FOREIGN TABLE oratab (
\&                id        integer           NOT NULL,
\&                text      character varying(30),
\&                floating  double precision  NOT NULL
\&        ) SERVER oradb OPTIONS (table \*(AqORATAB\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
Now you can use the table like a regular PostgreSQL table.
.Sp
See http://pgxn.org/dist/oracle_fdw/ for more information on this foreign data
wrapper.
.Sp
Release 10 adds a new export type destinated to evaluate the content of the
database to migrate, in terms of objects and cost to end the migration:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SHOW_REPORT  : show a detailled report of the Oracle database content.
.Ve
.Sp
Here is a sample of report:

.IX Item "ESTIMATE_COST"
Activate the migration cost evaluation. Must only be used with \s-1SHOW_REPORT,
FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, PACKAGE\s0 and \s-1QUERY\s0 export type. Default is disabled.
You may wat to use the \-\-estimate_cost command line option instead to activate
this functionnality. Note that enabling this directive will force \s-1PLSQL_PGSQL\s0
activation.
.IP "\s-1COST_UNIT_VALUE\s0" 4
.IX Item "COST_UNIT_VALUE"
Set the value in minutes of the migration cost evaluation unit. Default
is five minutes per unit. See \-\-cost_unit_value to change the unit value
at command line.
.IP "\s-1DUMP_AS_HTML\s0" 4
.IX Item "DUMP_AS_HTML"
By default when using \s-1SHOW_REPORT\s0 the migration report is generated as simple

.Sp
See http://ora2pg.darold.net/report.html for a sample report.
.IP "\s-1JOBS\s0" 4
.IX Item "JOBS"
This configuration directive adds multiprocess support to data export type,
the value is the number of process to use. Default is multiprocess disable.
.Sp
This directive is used to set the number of cores to used to parallelize
data import into PostgreSQL. It replace the old code based on Perl Threads
activated with the obsolete \s-1THREAD_COUNT\s0 configuration directive that was
not very useful and is now replaced with \fIfork()\fR calls.
.Sp
There's no more limitation in parallel processing than the number of cores
and the PostgreSQL I/O performance capabilities.
.Sp
Doesn't works under Windows Operating System, it is simply disabled.
.IP "\s-1ORACLE_COPIES\s0" 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_COPIES"
This configuration directive adds multiprocess support to extract data
from Oracle. The value is the number of process to use to parallelize
the select query. Default is parallel query disable.
.Sp
The parallelism is built on splitting the query following of the number
of cores given as value to \s-1ORACLE_COPIES\s0 as follow:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE ABS(MOD(COLUMN, ORACLE_COPIES)) = CUR_PROC
.Ve
.Sp
where \s-1COLUMN\s0 is a technical key like a primary or unique key where split
will be based and the current core used by the query (\s-1CUR_PROC\s0).
.Sp
Doesn't works under Windows Operating System, it is simply disabled.
.IP "\s-1DEFINED_PK\s0" 4
.IX Item "DEFINED_PK"
This directive is used to defined the technical key to used to split
the query between number of cores set with the \s-1ORACLE_COPIES\s0 variable.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        DEFINED_PK      EMPLOYEES:employee_id
.Ve
.Sp
The parallel query that will be used supposing that \-J or \s-1ORACLE_COPIES\s0
is set to 8:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE ABS(MOD(employee_id, 8)) = N
.Ve
.Sp
where N is the current process forked starting from 0.
.IP "\s-1PARALLEL_TABLES\s0" 4
.IX Item "PARALLEL_TABLES"
This directive is used to defined the number of tables that will be processed
in parallel for data extraction. The limit is the number of cores on your machine.
Ora2Pg will open one database connection for each parallel table extraction.
This directive, when upper than 1, will invalidate \s-1ORACLE_COPIES\s0 but not \s-1JOBS,\s0
so the real number of process that will be used if \s-1PARALLEL_TABLES\s0 * \s-1JOBS.\s0
.Sp
Note that this directive when set upper that 1 will also automatically enable
the \s-1FILE_PER_TABLE\s0 directive if your are exporting to files.
.IP "\s-1FDW_SERVER\s0" 4
.IX Item "FDW_SERVER"
This directive is used to set the name of the foreign data server that is used
in the \*(L"\s-1CREATE SERVER\s0 name \s-1FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER\s0 oracle_fdw ...\*(R" command. This
name will then be used in the \*(L"\s-1CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ...\*(R" SQL\s0 command. Default
is arbitrary set to orcl. This only concern export type \s-1FDW.\s0
.IP "\s-1EXTERNAL_TO_FDW\s0" 4

This directive, enabled by default, allow to export Oracle's External Tables as
file_fdw foreign tables. To not export these tables at all, set the directive
to 0.
.SS "Limiting object to export"
.IX Subsection "Limiting object to export"
You may want to export only a part of an Oracle database, here are a set of

database should be exported.
.IP "\s-1ALLOW\s0" 4
.IX Item "ALLOW"
This directive allow you to set a list of objects on witch the export must be
limited, excluding all other objects in the same type of export. The value is
a space or comma-separated list of objects name to export. You can include
valid regex into the list. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ALLOW           EMPLOYEES SALE_.* COUNTRIES .*_GEOM_SEQ
.Ve
.Sp
will export objects with name \s-1EMPLOYEES, COUNTRIES,\s0 all objects begining with
\&'\s-1SALE_\s0' and all objects with a name ending by '_GEOM_SEQ'. The object depends
of the export type. Note that regex will not works with 8i database.
.Sp
This directive replace the obsolete '\s-1TABLES\s0' configuration directive, this is
just a renaming to be less confusing.
.IP "\s-1EXCLUDE\s0" 4
.IX Item "EXCLUDE"
This directive is the opposite of the previous, it allow you to define a space
or comma-separated list of object name to exclude from the export. You can
include valid regex into the list. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXCLUDE         EMPLOYEES TMP_.* COUNTRIES
.Ve
.Sp
will exclude object with name \s-1EMPLOYEES, COUNTRIES\s0 and all tables begining with
\&'tmp_'.
.Sp
For example, you can ban from export some unwanted function with this directive:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXCLUDE         write_to_.* send_mail_.*
.Ve
.Sp
this example will exclude all functions, procedures or functions in a package
with the name begining with those regex. Note that regex will not works with
8i database.
.IP "\s-1VIEW_AS_TABLE\s0" 4
.IX Item "VIEW_AS_TABLE"
Set which view to export as table. By default none. Value must be a list of
view name or regexp separated by space or comma. If the object name is a view
and the export type is \s-1TABLE,\s0 the view will be exported as a create table
statement. If export type is \s-1COPY\s0 or \s-1INSERT,\s0 the corresponding data will be
exported.
.Sp
This was initialy done with the \s-1ALLOW \s0(or old \s-1TABLES\s0 directive) but that was
not allow to use both object exclusion and view as table.
.Sp
See chapter \*(L"Exporting Oracle views as PostgreSQL tables\*(R" for more details.
.IP "\s-1WHERE\s0" 4
.IX Item "WHERE"
This directive allow you to specify a \s-1WHERE\s0 clause filter when dumping the
contents of tables. Value is construct as follow: TABLE_NAME[\s-1WHERE_CLAUSE\s0], or
if you have only one where clause for each table just put the where clause as
value. Both are possible too. Here are some examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # Global where clause applying to all tables included in the export
\&        WHERE  1=1
\&
\&        # Apply the where clause only on table TABLE_NAME
\&        WHERE  TABLE_NAME[ID1=\*(Aq001\*(Aq]
\&
\&        # Applies two different clause on tables TABLE_NAME and OTHER_TABLE
\&        # and a generic where clause on DATE_CREATE to all other tables
\&        WHERE  TABLE_NAME[ID1=\*(Aq001\*(Aq OR ID1=\*(Aq002] DATE_CREATE > \*(Aq2001\-01\-01\*(Aq OTHER_TABLE[NAME=\*(Aqtest\*(Aq]
.Ve
.Sp
Any where clause not included into a table name bracket clause will be applied
to all exported table including the tables defined in the where clause. These
\&\s-1WHERE\s0 clauses are very useful if you want to archive some data or at the
opposite only export some recent data.
.IP "\s-1TOP_MAX\s0" 4
.IX Item "TOP_MAX"
This directive is used to limit the number of item shown in the top N lists
like the top list of tables per number of rows and the top list of largest
tables in megabytes. By default it is set to 10 items.
.IP "\s-1LOG_ON_ERROR\s0" 4
.IX Item "LOG_ON_ERROR"
Enable this directive if you want to continue direct data import on error.
When Ora2Pg received an error in the \s-1COPY\s0 or \s-1INSERT\s0 statement from PostgreSQL
it will log the statement to a file called TABLENAME_error.log in the output
directory and continue to next bulk of data. Like this you can try to fix the
statement and manually reload the error log file. Default is disabled: abort
import on error.
.SS "Modifying object structure"
.IX Subsection "Modifying object structure"
One of the great usage of Ora2Pg is its flexibility to replicate Oracle database
into PostgreSQL database with a different structure or schema. There's three
configuration directives that allow you to map those differences.
.IP "\s-1REORDERING_COLUMNS\s0" 4
.IX Item "REORDERING_COLUMNS"
Enable this directive to reordering columns and minimized the footprint
on disc, so that more rows fit on a data page, which is the most important
factor for speed. Default is disabled, that mean the same order than in
Oracle tables definition, that's should be enough for most usage. This
directive is only used with \s-1TABLE\s0 export.
.IP "\s-1MODIFY_STRUCT\s0" 4
.IX Item "MODIFY_STRUCT"
This directive allow you to limit the columns to extract for a given table. The
value consist in a space-separated list of table name with a set of column
between parenthesis as follow:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        MODIFY_STRUCT   NOM_TABLE(nomcol1,nomcol2,...) ...
.Ve
.Sp
for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        MODIFY_STRUCT   T_TEST1(id,dossier) T_TEST2(id,fichier)
.Ve
.Sp
This will only extract columns 'id' and 'dossier' from table T_TEST1 and columns
\&'id' and 'fichier' from the T_TEST2 table. This directive is only used with \s-1COPY\s0
or \s-1INSERT\s0 export.
.IP "\s-1MODIFY_TYPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "MODIFY_TYPE"
Some time you need to force the destination type, for example a column
exported as timestamp by Ora2Pg can be forced into type date. Value is
a comma-separated list of \s-1TABLE:COLUMN:TYPE\s0 structure. If you need to use
comma or space inside type definintion you will have to backslach them.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        TABLE1:COL3:varchar,TABLE1:COL4:decimal(9\e,6)
.Ve
.IP "\s-1REPLACE_TABLES\s0" 4
.IX Item "REPLACE_TABLES"
This directive allow you to remap a list of Oracle table name to a PostgreSQL table name during export. The value is a list of space-separated values with the following structure:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_TABLES  ORIG_TBNAME1:DEST_TBNAME1 ORIG_TBNAME2:DEST_TBNAME2
.Ve
.Sp
Oracle tables \s-1ORIG_TBNAME1\s0 and \s-1ORIG_TBNAME2\s0 will be respectively renamed into
\&\s-1DEST_TBNAME1\s0 and \s-1DEST_TBNAME2\s0
.IP "\s-1REPLACE_COLS\s0" 4
.IX Item "REPLACE_COLS"
Like table name, the name of the column can be remapped to a different name
using the following syntaxe:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_COLS    ORIG_TBNAME(ORIG_COLNAME1:NEW_COLNAME1,ORIG_COLNAME2:NEW_COLNAME2)
.Ve
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_COLS    T_TEST(dico:dictionary,dossier:folder)
.Ve
.Sp
will rename Oracle columns 'dico' and 'dossier' from table T_TEST into new name
\&'dictionary' and 'folder'.
.IP "\s-1REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN\s0" 4
.IX Item "REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN"
If you want to change the type of some Oracle columns into PostgreSQL boolean
during the export you can define here a list of tables and column separated by
space as follow.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN     TB_NAME1:COL_NAME1 TB_NAME1:COL_NAME2 TB_NAME2:COL_NAME2
.Ve
.Sp
The values set in the boolean columns list will be replaced with the 't' and 'f'
following the default replacement values and those additionally set in directive
\&\s-1BOOLEAN_VALUES.\s0
.Sp
You can also give a type and a precision to automatically convert all fields of
that type as a boolean. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN      NUMBER:1 CHAR:1 TB_NAME1:COL_NAME1 TB_NAME1:COL_NAME2
.Ve
.Sp
will also replace any field of type \fInumber\fR\|(1) or \fIchar\fR\|(1) as a boolean in all exported
tables.
.IP "\s-1BOOLEAN_VALUES\s0" 4
.IX Item "BOOLEAN_VALUES"
Use this to add additional definition of the possible boolean values used in
Oracle fields. You must set a space-separated list of \s-1TRUE:FALSE\s0 values. By
default here are the values recognized by Ora2Pg:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        BOOLEAN_VALUES          yes:no y:n 1:0 true:false enabled:disabled
.Ve
.Sp
Any values defined here will be added to the default list.
.IP "\s-1INDEXES_SUFFIX\s0" 4
.IX Item "INDEXES_SUFFIX"
Add the given value as suffix to indexes names. Useful if you have indexes
with same name as tables. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        INDEXES_SUFFIX          _idx
.Ve
.Sp
will add _idx at ed of all index name. Not so common but can help.
.IP "\s-1PREFIX_PARTITION\s0" 4
.IX Item "PREFIX_PARTITION"
Enable this directive if you want that your partition table name will be
exported using the parent table name. Disabled by default. If you have
multiple partitioned table, when exported to PostgreSQL some partitions
could have the same name but dfferent parent tables. This is not allowed,
table name must be unique.
.SS "Oracle Spatial to PostGis"
.IX Subsection "Oracle Spatial to PostGis"
Ora2Pg fully export Spatial object from Oracle database. There's some
configuration directives that could be used to control the export.
.IP "\s-1AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE"
Enable this directive if you want Ora2Pg to detect the real spatial type and
dimension used in a spatial column. Otherwise column will be created with
non-constrained \*(L"geometry\*(R" type. Enabling this feature will force Ora2Pg to
scan a sample of 50000 column to look at the \s-1GTYPE\s0 used. You can increase
the sample by setting the value of \s-1AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE\s0 to the desired
number of line. The directive is enabled by default.
.Sp
For example, in the case of a column named shape and defined with Oracle type
\&\s-1SDO_GEOMETRY,\s0 with \s-1AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE\s0 disabled it will be converted as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    shape geometry(GEOMETRY) or shape geometry(GEOMETRYZ, 4326)
.Ve
.Sp
and if the directive is enabled and the column just contains a single
geometry type that use a single dimension:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    shape geometry(POLIGON, 4326) or shape geometry(POLIGONZ, 4326)
.Ve
.Sp
with a two or three dimensional polygon.
.IP "\s-1CONVERT_SRID\s0" 4
.IX Item "CONVERT_SRID"
This directive allow you to control the automatically convertion of Oracle
\&\s-1SRID\s0 to standard \s-1EPSG.\s0 If enabled, Ora2Pg will use the Oracle function
sdo_cs.\fImap_oracle_srid_to_epsg()\fR to convert all \s-1SRID.\s0 Enabled by default.
.Sp
If the \s-1SDO_SRID\s0 returned by Oracle is \s-1NULL,\s0 it will be replaced by the
default value 8307 converted to its \s-1EPSG\s0 value: 4326 (see \s-1DEFAULT_SRID\s0).
.Sp
If the value is upper than 1, all \s-1SRID\s0 will be forced to this value, in
this case \s-1DEFAULT_SRID\s0 will not be used when Oracle returns a null value
and the value will be forced to \s-1CONVERT_SRID.\s0
.IP "\s-1DEFAULT_SRID\s0" 4
.IX Item "DEFAULT_SRID"
Use this directive to override the default \s-1EPSG SRID\s0 to used: 4326.
Can be overwritten by \s-1CONVERT_SRID,\s0 see above.
.IP "\s-1USE_SC40_PACKAGE\s0" 4
.IX Item "USE_SC40_PACKAGE"
If you want to replace call to \s-1SDO_UTIL.\fITO_WKTGEOMETRY\s0()\fR by a call to the
more efficient methode \s-1SC4O\s0.\fIST_AsText()\fR, especially for 3D geomrtry, activate
this directive. You must install the \s-1SC40\s0 package before, this is the
SpatialDB Advisor extension developped by Simon Greener and available at
http://www.spatialdbadvisor.com/source_code_form
.Sp
If \s-1SC40\s0 is not installed in the same schema, you can set the value to the
schema name. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&             USE_SC40_PACKAGE   CODESYS
.Ve
.Sp
The function will be called as \s-1CODESYS.SC4O\s0.\fIST_AsText()\fR.
.IP "\s-1POSTGIS_SCHEMA\s0" 4
.IX Item "POSTGIS_SCHEMA"
Use this directive to add a specific schema to the search path to look
for PostGis functions.
.SS "PostgreSQL Import"
.IX Subsection "PostgreSQL Import"
By default conversion to PostgreSQL format is written to file 'output.sql'.
The command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        psql mydb < output.sql
.Ve
.PP
will import content of file output.sql into PostgreSQL mydb database.
.IP "\s-1DATA_LIMIT\s0" 4
.IX Item "DATA_LIMIT"
When you are performing \s-1INSERT/COPY\s0 export Ora2Pg proceed by chunks of \s-1DATA_LIMIT\s0
tuples for speed improvement. Tuples are stored in memory before being written
to disk, so if you want speed and have enough system resources you can grow
this limit to an upper value for example: 100000 or 1000000. Before release 7.0
a value of 0 mean no limit so that all tuples are stored in memory before being
flushed to disk. In 7.x branch this has been remove and chunk will be set to the
default: 10000
.IP "\s-1OUTPUT\s0" 4
.IX Item "OUTPUT"
The Ora2Pg output filename can be changed with this directive. Default value is
output.sql. if you set the file name with extension .gz or .bz2 the output will
be automatically compressed. This require that the Compress::Zlib Perl module
is installed if the filename extension is .gz and that the bzip2 system command
is installed for the .bz2 extension.
.IP "\s-1OUTPUT_DIR\s0" 4
.IX Item "OUTPUT_DIR"
Since release 7.0, you can define a base directory where wfile will be written.
The directory must exists.
.IP "\s-1BZIP2\s0" 4
.IX Item "BZIP2"
This directive allow you to specify the full path to the bzip2 program if it
can not be found in the \s-1PATH\s0 environment variable.
.IP "\s-1FILE_PER_CONSTRAINT\s0" 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_CONSTRAINT"
Allow object constraints to be saved in a separate file during schema export.
The file will be named \s-1CONSTRAINTS_OUTPUT,\s0 where \s-1OUTPUT\s0 is the value of the
corresponding configuration directive. You can use .gz xor .bz2 extension to
enable compression. Default is to save all data in the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 file. This
directive is usable only with \s-1TABLE\s0 export type.
.IP "\s-1FILE_PER_INDEX\s0" 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_INDEX"
Allow indexes to be saved in a separate file during schema export. The file
will be named \s-1INDEXES_OUTPUT,\s0 where \s-1OUTPUT\s0 is the value of the corresponding
configuration directive. You can use .gz xor .bz2 file extension to enable
compression. Default is to save all data in the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 file. This directive
is usable only with \s-1TABLE AND TABLESPACE\s0 export type. With the \s-1TABLESPACE\s0
export, it is used to write \*(L"\s-1ALTER INDEX ... TABLESPACE ...\*(R"\s0 into a separate
file named \s-1TBSP_INDEXES_OUPUT\s0 that can be loaded at end of the migration after
the indexes creation to move the indexes.
.IP "\s-1FILE_PER_TABLE\s0" 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_TABLE"
Allow data export to be saved in one file per table/view. The files will be
named as tablename_OUTPUT, where \s-1OUTPUT\s0 is the value of the corresponding
configuration directive. You can still use .gz xor .bz2 extension in the \s-1OUTPUT\s0
directive to enable compression. Default 0 will save all data in one file, set
it to 1 to enable this feature. This is usable only during \s-1INSERT\s0 or \s-1COPY\s0 export
type.
.IP "\s-1FILE_PER_FUNCTION\s0" 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_FUNCTION"
Allow functions, procedures and triggers to be saved in one file per object.
The files will be named as objectname_OUTPUT. Where \s-1OUTPUT\s0 is the value of the
corresponding configuration directive. You can still use .gz xor .bz2 extension
in the \s-1OUTPUT\s0 directive to enable compression. Default 0 will save all in one
single file, set it to 1 to enable this feature. This is usable only during the
corresponding export type, the package body export has a special behavior.
.Sp
When export type is \s-1PACKAGE\s0 and you've enabled this directive, Ora2Pg will
create a directory per package, named with the lower case name of the package,
and will create one file per function/procedure into that directory. If the
configuration directive is not enabled, it will create one file per package as
packagename_OUTPUT, where \s-1OUTPUT\s0 is the value of the corresponding directive.
.IP "\s-1TRUNCATE_TABLE\s0" 4
.IX Item "TRUNCATE_TABLE"
If this directive is set to 1, a \s-1TRUNCATE TABLE\s0 instruction will be add before
loading data. This is usable only during \s-1INSERT\s0 or \s-1COPY\s0 export type.
.IP "\s-1STOP_ON_ERROR\s0" 4
.IX Item "STOP_ON_ERROR"
Set this parameter to 0 to not include the call to \eset \s-1ON_ERROR_STOP ON\s0 in
all \s-1SQL\s0 scripts generated by Ora2Pg. By default this order is always present
so that the script will immediatly abort when an error is encountered.
.PP
If you want to import data on the fly to the PostgreSQL database you have three
configuration directives to set the PostgreSQL database connection. This is only
possible with \s-1COPY\s0 or \s-1INSERT\s0 export type as for database schema there's no real
interest to do that.
.IP "\s-1PG_DSN\s0" 4
.IX Item "PG_DSN"
Use this directive to set the PostgreSQL data source namespace using DBD::Pg
Perl module as follow:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:Pg:dbname=pgdb;host=localhost;port=5432
.Ve
.Sp
will connect to database 'pgdb' on localhost at tcp port 5432.
.IP "\s-1PG_USER\s0 and \s-1PG_PWD\s0" 4
.IX Item "PG_USER and PG_PWD"
These two directives are used to set the login user and password.
.IP "\s-1SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT\s0" 4
.IX Item "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT"
Specifies whether transaction commit will wait for \s-1WAL\s0 records to be written
to disk before the command returns a \*(L"success\*(R" indication to the client. This
is the equivalent to set synchronous_commit directive of postgresql.conf file.
This is only used when you load data directly to PostgreSQL, the default is
off to disable synchronous commit to gain speed at writing data. Some modified
version of PostgreSQL, like greenplum, do not have this setting, so in this
set this directive to 1, ora2pg will not  try to change the setting.
.SS "Taking export under control"
.IX Subsection "Taking export under control"
The following other configuration directives interact directly with the export process and give you fine granuality in database export control.
.IP "\s-1SKIP\s0" 4
.IX Item "SKIP"
For \s-1TABLE\s0 export you may not want to export all schema constraints, the \s-1SKIP\s0
configuration directive allow you to specify a space-separated list of
constraints that should not be exported. Possible values are:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        \- fkeys: turn off foreign key constraints
\&        \- pkeys: turn off primary keys
\&        \- ukeys: turn off unique column constraints
\&        \- indexes: turn off all other index types
\&        \- checks: turn off check constraints
.Ve
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SKIP    indexes,checks
.Ve
.Sp
will removed indexes ans check constraints from export.
.IP "\s-1PKEY_IN_CREATE\s0" 4
.IX Item "PKEY_IN_CREATE"
Enable this directive if you want to add primary key definition inside the
create table statement. If disabled (the default) primary key definition
will be add with an alter table statement. Enable it if you are exporting
to GreenPlum PostgreSQL database.
.IP "\s-1KEEP_PKEY_NAMES\s0" 4
.IX Item "KEEP_PKEY_NAMES"
By default names of the primary and unique key in the source Oracle database
are ignored and key names are created in the target PostgreSQL database with
the PostgreSQL internal default naming rules. If you want to preserve Oracle
primary key names set this option to 1.
.IP "\s-1FKEY_DEFERRABLE\s0" 4
.IX Item "FKEY_DEFERRABLE"
When exporting tables, Ora2Pg normally exports constraints as they are, if they
are non-deferrable they are exported as non-deferrable. However, non-deferrable
constraints will probably cause problems when attempting to import data to Pg.
The \s-1FKEY_DEFERRABLE\s0 option set to 1 will cause all foreign key constraints to
be exported as deferrable.
.IP "\s-1DEFER_FKEY\s0" 4
.IX Item "DEFER_FKEY"
In addition, when exporting data the \s-1DEFER_FKEY\s0 option set to 1 will add a
command to defer all foreign key constraints during data export. Constraints
will then be checked at the end of each transaction. Note that this will works
only if foreign keys are deferrable and that all data can stay in a single
transaction. This will work only if foreign keys have been exported as
deferrables. Constraints will then be checked at the end of the transaction.
.Sp
This directive can also be enabled if you want to force all foreign keys to
be created as deferrable and initially deferred during schema export (\s-1TABLE\s0
export type). Since release 11.5 only.
.IP "\s-1DROP_FKEY\s0" 4
.IX Item "DROP_FKEY"
When this directive is enabled Ora2Pg forces the deletion of all foreign
keys before data import and to recreate them at end of the data import.
.IP "\s-1DROP_INDEXES\s0" 4
.IX Item "DROP_INDEXES"
This direction is also introduce since version 7.0 and allow you to gain lot of
speed improvement during data import by removing all indexes that are not an
automatic index (ex: indexes of primary keys) and recreate them at the end of
data import.
.IP "\s-1DISABLE_TRIGGERS\s0" 4
.IX Item "DISABLE_TRIGGERS"
This directive is used to disable triggers on all tables in \s-1COPY\s0 or \s-1INSERT\s0 export
modes. Available values are iO, \s-1USER \s0(disable userdefined triggers only) and \s-1ALL
\&\s0(includes \s-1RI\s0 system triggers). Default is 0: do not add \s-1SQL\s0 statements to disable
trigger before data import.
.Sp
If you want to disable triggers during data migration, set the value to
\&\s-1USER\s0 if your are connected as non superuser and \s-1ALL\s0 if you are connected
as PostgreSQL superuser. A value of 1 is equal to \s-1USER.\s0
.IP "\s-1DISABLE_SEQUENCE\s0" 4
.IX Item "DISABLE_SEQUENCE"
If set to 1 disables alter of sequences on all tables during \s-1COPY\s0 or \s-1INSERT\s0 export
mode. This is used to prevent the update of sequence during data migration.
Default is 0, alter sequences.
.IP "\s-1NOESCAPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "NOESCAPE"
By default all data that are not of type date or time are escaped. If you
experience any problem with that you can set it to 1 to disable character
escaping during data export. This directive is only used during a \s-1COPY\s0 export.
See \s-1STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS\s0 for enabling/disabling escape with \s-1INSERT\s0
statements.
.IP "\s-1STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS\s0" 4
.IX Item "STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS"
This controls whether ordinary string literals ('...') treat backslashes
literally, as specified in \s-1SQL\s0 standard. This was the default before Ora2Pg
v8.5 so that all strings was escaped first, now this is currently on, causing
Ora2Pg to use the escape string syntax (E'...') if this parameter is not
set to 0. This is the exact behavior of the same option in PostgreSQL.
This directive is only used during data export to build \s-1INSERT\s0 statements.
See \s-1NOESCAPE\s0 for enabling/disabling escape in \s-1COPY\s0 statements.
.IP "\s-1PG_NUMERIC_TYPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "PG_NUMERIC_TYPE"
If set to 1 replace portable numeric type into PostgreSQL internal type.
Oracle data type \s-1NUMBER\s0(p,s) is approximatively converted to real and
float PostgreSQL data type. If you have monetary fields or don't want
rounding issues with the extra decimals you should preserve the same
numeric(p,s) PostgreSQL data type. Do that only if you need very good
precision because using numeric(p,s) is slower than using real or double.
.IP "\s-1PG_INTEGER_TYPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "PG_INTEGER_TYPE"
If set to 1 replace portable numeric type into PostgreSQL internal type.
Oracle data type \s-1NUMBER\s0(p) or \s-1NUMBER\s0 are converted to smallint, integer
or bigint PostgreSQL data type following the length of the precision. If
\&\s-1NUMBER\s0 without precision are set to \s-1DEFAULT_NUMERIC \s0(see bellow).
.IP "\s-1DEFAULT_NUMERIC\s0" 4
.IX Item "DEFAULT_NUMERIC"
\&\s-1NUMBER\s0 without precision are converted by default to bigint only if
\&\s-1PG_INTEGER_TYPE\s0 is true. You can overwrite this value to any \s-1PG\s0 type,
like integer or float.
.IP "\s-1DATA_TYPE\s0" 4
.IX Item "DATA_TYPE"
If you're experiencing any problem in data type schema conversion with this
directive you can take full control of the correspondence between Oracle and
PostgreSQL types to redefine data type translation used in Ora2pg. The syntax
is a comma-separated list of \*(L"Oracle datatype:Postgresql datatype\*(R". Here are
the default list used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        DATA_TYPE       DATE:timestamp,LONG:text,LONG RAW:bytea,CLOB:text,NCLOB:text,BLOB:bytea,BFILE:bytea,RAW:bytea,ROWID:oid,FLOAT:double precision,DEC:decimal,DECIMAL:decimal,DOUBLE PRECISION:double precision,INT:integer,INTEGER:integer,REAL:real,SMALLINT:smallint,BINARY_FLOAT:double precision,BINARY_DOUBLE:double precision,TIMESTAMP:timestamp,XMLTYPE:xml,BINARY_INTEGER:integer,PLS_INTEGER:integer,TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE:timestamp with time zone,TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE:timestamp with time zone
.Ve
.Sp
Note that the directive and the list definition must be a single line.
.Sp
There's a special case with \s-1BFILE\s0 when they are converted to text field, they will
contains the path to the external file. If you set the destination type to bytea, the

By default Oracle character set is automatically detected, but if you experience
any issues where mutibyte characters are being substituted with some replacement
characters during the export try to set the \s-1NLS_LANG\s0 configuration directive to

If you experience the Perl warning: \*(L"Wide character in print\*(R", it means that
you tried to write a Unicode string to a non-unicode file handle. You can force
Perl to use binary mode for output by setting the \s-1BINMODE\s0 configuration option
to the specified encoding. If you set it to 'utf8', it will force printing like
this: binmode \s-1OUTFH, \s0\*(L":utf8\*(R"; By default Ora2Pg opens the output file in 'raw'
binary mode.

This directive is use to enable/disable the plsql to pgplsql conversion part
that could break the original code if they include complex subqueries.
Default is enabled, you must disabled if to preserve backward compatibility.
This concern the following replacement: \fIdecode()\fR, \fIsubstr()\fR
.Sp
For example code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        substr(decode("db_status",\*(Aqactive\*(Aq,"dbname",null),1,128)
.Ve
.Sp
can easily be replaced by the PostgreSQL equivalent:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        substring((CASE WHEN "db_status"=\*(Aqactive\*(Aq THEN "dbname" ELSE NULL END) from 1 for 128))
.Ve
.Sp
The problem could comes when you introduce subquery into one of the \fIsubstr()\fR
or \fIdecode()\fR parameter. For example the replacement of
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        substr(decode("db_status",(select status from dbcluster where lbl=substr("dbname",1,3)),"dbname",null),1,128)
.Ve
.Sp
will break the code. You can still compare to the original Oracle code and
solve the problem, but if you want you can disable this unsecure replacement.
.IP "\s-1NULL_EQUAL_EMPTY\s0" 4

.SS "Materialized view"
.IX Subsection "Materialized view"
Since PostgreSQL 9.3, materialized view are supported with the \s-1CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW\s0 syntax,
to force Ora2Pg to use the native PostgreSQL support you must enable the configuration
directive \s-1PG_SUPPORTS_MVIEW.\s0
.PP
In other case Ora2Pg will export all materialized views as \*(L"Snapshot Materialized Views\*(R" as explain
in this document: http://tech.jonathangardner.net/wiki/PostgreSQL/Materialized_Views.
.PP
When exporting materialized view Ora2Pg will first add the \s-1SQL\s0 code to create the \*(L"materialized_views\*(R" table:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        CREATE TABLE materialized_views (
\&                mview_name text NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
\&                view_name text NOT NULL,
\&                iname text,
\&                last_refresh TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
\&        );
.Ve
.PP
all materialized views will have an entry in this table. It then adds the plpgsql code to create tree functions:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        create_materialized_view(text, text, text) used to create a materialized view
\&        drop_materialized_view(text) used to delete a materialized view
\&        refresh_full_materialized_view(text) used to refresh a view
.Ve
.PP
then it adds the \s-1SQL\s0 code to create the view and the materialized view:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        CREATE VIEW mviewname_mview AS
\&        SELECT ... FROM ...;
\&
\&        SELECT create_materialized_view(\*(Aqmviewname\*(Aq,\*(Aqmviewname_mview\*(Aq, change with the name of the colum to used for the index);
.Ve
.PP
The first argument is the name of the materializd view, the second the name of the view on which the materialized view is based
and the third is the column name on which the index should be build (aka most od the time the primary key). This column is not
automatically deduced so you need to repace its name.
.PP
As said above Ora2Pg only supports snapshot materialized views so the table will be entirely refreshed by issuing first a truncate
of the table and then by load again all data from the view:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&         refresh_full_materialized_view(\*(Aqmviewname\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
To drop the materialized view you just have to call the \fIdrop_materialized_view()\fR function with the name of the materialized view
as parameter.
.SS "Other configuration directives"

You can define common Ora2Pg configuration directives into a single file that
can be imported into other configuration files with the \s-1IMPORT\s0 configuration
directive as follow:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        IMPORT  commonfile.conf
.Ve
.Sp
will import all configuration directives defined into commonfile.conf into the
current configuration file.
.SS "Exporting Oracle views as PostgreSQL tables"
.IX Subsection "Exporting Oracle views as PostgreSQL tables"
You can export any Oracle view as a PostgreSQL table simply by setting \s-1TYPE\s0
configuration option to \s-1TABLE\s0 to have the corresponding create table statement.
Or use type \s-1COPY\s0 or \s-1INSERT\s0 to export the corresponding data. To allow that you
have to specify your views in the \s-1VIEW_AS_TABLE\s0 configuration option.
.PP
Then if Ora2Pg finds the view it will extract its schema (if TYPE=TABLE) into
a \s-1PG\s0 create table form, then it will extract the data (if TYPE=COPY or \s-1INSERT\s0)
following the view schema.
.PP
You can use the \s-1ALLOW\s0 and \s-1EXCLUDE\s0 directive in addition to select the others
objects to export.
.SS "Export as Kettle transformation \s-1XML\s0 files"
.IX Subsection "Export as Kettle transformation XML files"
The \s-1KETTLE\s0 export type is useful if you want to use Penthalo Data Integrator
(Kettle) to import data to PostgreSQL. With this type of export Ora2Pg will
generate one \s-1XML\s0 Kettle transformation files (.ktr) per table and add a line
to manually execute the transformation in the output.sql file. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-c ora2pg.conf \-t KETTLE \-j 12 \-a MYTABLE \-o load_mydata.sh
.Ve
.PP
will generate one file called '\s-1HR.MYTABLE\s0.ktr' and add a line to the output
file (load_mydata.sh):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #!/bin/sh
\&
\&        KETTLE_TEMPLATE_PATH=\*(Aq.\*(Aq
\&
\&        JAVAMAXMEM=4096 ./pan.sh \-file $KETTLE_TEMPLATE_PATH/HR.MYTABLE.ktr \-level Detailed
.Ve
.PP
The \-j 12 option will create a template with 12 processes to insert data into
PostgreSQL. It is also possible to specify the number of parallel queries used
to extract data from the Oracle with the \-J command line option as follow:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-c ora2pg.conf \-t KETTLE \-J 4 \-j 12 \-a EMPLOYEES \-o load_mydata.sh
.Ve
.PP
This is only possible if you have defined the technical key to used to split
the query between cores in the \s-1DEFINED_PKEY\s0 configuration directive. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        DEFINED_PK      EMPLOYEES:employee_id
.Ve
.PP
will force the number of Oracle connection copies to 4 and defined the \s-1SQL\s0 query
as follow in the Kettle \s-1XML\s0 transformation file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <sql>SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES WHERE ABS(MOD(employee_id,${Internal.Step.Unique.Count}))=${Internal.Step.Unique.Number}</sql>
.Ve
.PP
The \s-1KETTLE\s0 export type requires that the Oracle and PostgreSQL \s-1DSN\s0 are defined.
You can also activate the \s-1TRUNCATE_TABLE\s0 directive to force a truncation of the
table before data import.
.PP
The \s-1KETTLE\s0 export type is an original work of Marc Cousin.
.SS "Migration cost assessment"
.IX Subsection "Migration cost assessment"
Estimating the cost of a migration process from Oracle to PostgreSQL is not easy. To
obtain a good assessment of this migration cost, Ora2Pg will inspect all database
objects, all functions and stored procedures to detect if there's still some objects
and \s-1PL/SQL\s0 code that can not be automatically converted by Ora2Pg.
.PP
Ora2Pg has a content analysis mode that inspect the Oracle database to generate a
text report on what the Oracle database contains and what can not be exported.
.PP
To activate the \*(L"analysis and report\*(R" mode, you have to use the export de type

The last line shows the total estimated migration code in man-days following the
number of migration units estimated for each object. This migration unit represent
around five minutes for a PostgreSQL expert. If this is your first migration you can
get it higher with the configuration directive \s-1COST_UNIT_VALUE\s0 or the \-\-cost_unit_value
command line option:

.SS "Migration assessment method"
.IX Subsection "Migration assessment method"
Migration unit scores given to each type of Oracle database object are defined in the
Perl library lib/Ora2Pg/PLSQL.pm in the \f(CW%OBJECT_SCORE\fR variable definition.
.PP
The number of \s-1PL/SQL\s0 lines associated to a migration unit is also defined in this file
in the \f(CW$SIZE_SCORE\fR variable value.
.PP
The number of migration units associated to each \s-1PL/SQL\s0 code difficulties can be found
in the same Perl library lib/Ora2Pg/PLSQL.pm in the hash \f(CW%UNCOVERED_SCORE\fR initialization.
.PP
This assessment method is a work in progress so I'm expecting feedbacks on migration
experiences to polish the scores/units attribued in those variables.
.SS "Hints"
.IX Subsection "Hints"
Converting your queries with Oracle style outer join (+) syntax to \s-1ANSI\s0 standard \s-1SQL\s0 at
the Oracle side can save you lot of time for the migration. You can use \s-1TOAD\s0 Query Builder
can re-write these using the proper \s-1ANSI\s0 syntax, see: http://www.toadworld.com/products/toad\-for\-oracle/f/10/t/9518.aspx

There's also an alternative with \s-1SQL\s0 Developer Data Modeler, see

with very specials thanks to Dominique Legendre for his help on testing and
retesting all Ora2pg features and suggesting numerous improvements. About
the migration cost assessment part, I want to thanks Philippe Lang \- Service
Delivery Manager, Atos \- for the complete review of the french documentation
and the global project management. All my recognition goes to the French DGFiP
(Direction Generale des Finances Publiques) who asked for that great Ora2Pg
improvement and of course Dalibo who offer me the opportunity to work on this
project and PostgreSQL in general.
.PP
And all others who help me to build a useful and reliable product:
